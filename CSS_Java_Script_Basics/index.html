                <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing for maximum flexibility
                    for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments
                    to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values -
                        imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
                        JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called
                        identifiers. <a class="highlited-text">var x;</a></li>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup
                        can now have coffee poured into it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment
                        operator assigns a value to a variable. <a class="highlited-text">var x = 10;</a></li>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you
                        need to know the data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null
                        aka nothing; Number - <a class="highlited-text">42</a> or <a class="highlited-text">3.14159;</a> String - <a class="highlited-text">“Coding Dojo Rocks!”;</a> Array - <a class="highlited-text">[1, ‘Coding’, 2,
                        ‘Dojo’];</a> and Object - <a class="highlited-text">{first_name: ‘Jane’, last_name: ‘Doe’}</a></li>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different
                        decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been met.
                        You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
                        conditional statements: <a class="highlited-text">if</a> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <a class="highlited-text">else
                        if</a> to specify a new condition to test; if the first condition is false; <a class="highlited-text">else</a> we execute this
                        block of code;</li>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
                        essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have
                        to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                    <li><a class="link-color">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call out function this
                        will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
                        putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and get started, first we
                        screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                        instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over
                        and over again.</li>
